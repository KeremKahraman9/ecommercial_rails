## 15-Day E-Commerce Website Development Challenge

Welcome to my 15-day e-commerce website development challenge repository! In this challenge, I'll be building an e-commerce website using Ruby on Rails and commiting my progress day by day.

## Project Overview

The goal of this challenge is to build a fully functional e-commerce website that includes features such as product listings, shopping cart, user authentication, order processing, and more. And of course I improve my code skills and my mindset while making this project.

Each day's progress will be documented in a separate folder, where you can find the code and a brief summary of the tasks completed on that day.
